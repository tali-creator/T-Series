# Movie App - T-Series  

## Introduction

Welcome to my Movie App project! This is a simple web application that displays movies and their details. You can browse through different movie categories, view details about individual movies, and even upload images. This app was built using React and uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally on your computer, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/tali-creator/T-Series.git
cd movie-app

 ## 2. Install Dependencies
Once you have the project, you need to install the necessary packages. Run the following command to install everything:


npm install
This will install all the required dependencies for both the front-end and back-end.


## 3. Set Up the TMDb API Key
In order to fetch movie data, you need an API Key from The Movie Database (TMDb). Here's how to get it:

Go to TMDb's website.
Sign up or log in.
Visit your account settings and find your API key.
Create a .env file in the root of your project (next to package.json) and add your key like this:
env

VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

to make things 


### 4. Run the Development Server
After you've installed the dependencies and set up the API key, you can start the development server by running:



npm run dev
This will start the app and you should see it running at http://localhost:3000 in your browser!
